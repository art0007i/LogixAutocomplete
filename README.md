## NOTE: This mod is currently unfinished.

## Dependencies
- [ReflectionHelper](https://github.com/art0007i/ReflectionHelper)
- [SpecialItemsLib](https://github.com/art0007i/SpecialItemsLib)

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that attempts to add some form of autocompletion to logix.

### Usage
To use the mod just grab a logix tooltip and press secondary to spawn an input, you will then get a list of things that can be plugged into it.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [LogixAutocomplete.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/LogixAutocomplete/releases/latest/download/LogixAutocomplete.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
